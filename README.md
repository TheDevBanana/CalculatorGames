# CalculatorGames
Games I made on the TI-84 Plus CE Python

it's possible these just don't work but idk

To put them on the calculator, move the files onto the calculator using TI Connect. For flappy bird, move over the FlappyBird.8xp file, and the two images. For pong, move over the Pong.8xp file. 

To run them, press program, then TI-Basic, and then choose the right program.

To exit the games, press on while running them. There is no system built in to reset the graph settings after, so be aware that you will need to manually revert all of your format options after.
